# roblox-puzzle-fuzzer
Bruteforces all words in /e command given a wordlist, in a Roblox game.
To terminate the process midway, move your cursor to your screen's top left corner.

### Usage
```bash
solve.py [-h] input.txt

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

### Note
i haven't tested the minimum message sending cooldown that won't get you banned (?)<br>
only know that it takes 20 message of rapidly spamming in idk interval to rate limit you<br>
there's isnt much resource that goes in-depth about spamming stuff so good luck not getting banned ðŸ˜…
